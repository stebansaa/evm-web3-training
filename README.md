Introduction to EVM and web3: In this lesson, students will be introduced to the basics of EVM and web3, including their history, key concepts, and applications. Students will learn about the origins and evolution of EVM, the role of web3 in the blockchain ecosystem, and the basics of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).

Setting up the development environment: In this lesson, students will learn how to set up a development environment for EVM and web3 development, including how to install the necessary tools and libraries, such as Solidity and Truffle. Students will also learn how to create and configure a new EVM project, and how to use the development console and debugger to test and debug their code.

Writing and deploying smart contracts: In this lesson, students will learn how to write and deploy smart contracts using Solidity and Truffle. Students will learn the basics of Solidity syntax, including data types, functions, and control structures, as well as how to use Truffle to compile, deploy, and test their contracts. Students will also learn how to use web3 to interact with their contracts, including how to call functions and read and write data to the blockchain.

Building decentralized applications: In this lesson, students will learn how to build decentralized applications (DApps) using EVM and web3. Students will learn how to use web3 to connect their DApps to the blockchain, how to integrate smart contracts and user interfaces, and how to handle security and user authentication. Students will also learn how to deploy and test their DApps, and how to use common tools and frameworks, such as React and MetaMask, to enhance their DApps' functionality and usability.

Advanced EVM and web3 topics: In this final lesson, students will explore advanced topics in EVM and web3, such as scaling and performance, interoper
